DevSec Hardening Framework project is releasing a new major release [chef-os-hardening 3.0.0](https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening/releases/tag/v3.0.0) today.

The major points of this release are listed below, many thanks for the contributions and help we received from our users and community!

**Highlights and breaking changes:**

- Blacklisting of filesystems ([PR 169](https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening/pull/169)). **Important:** vfat is included in the default list, so be careful if you have some desktop systems.
- SELinux support for RHEL family distributions. SELinux is unmanaged per default and can be enabled via setting `['os-hardening']['security']['selinux_mode']` ([PR 173](https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening/pull/173), many thanks to [AnMoeller](https://github.com/AnMoeller) for this contribution)
- Adaptation of some attributes to better RH defaults ([PR 177](https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening/pull/177), many thanks to [strangeman](https://github.com/strangeman) for updating the baseline)

**New attributes and features:**

- `['os-hardening']['security']['selinux_mode']` controls the SELinux mode on RH-family distributions
- `['os-hardening']['security']['kernel']['disable_filesystems']` list of filesystem kernel modules, which are blacklisted for loading.

**Bugfixes and improvements:**

- Fedora CI tests are fixed ([PR 179](https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening/pull/179), many thanks to [@shoekstra](https://github.com/shoekstra) for this contribution)
- Ownership of `/var/log` fixed for Ubuntu systems ([PR 178](https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening/pull/178), many thanks to [@shoekstra](https://github.com/shoekstra) for this contribution)
- Fix for failures on fedora with missing yum installation ([PR 176](https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening/pull/176))
- Fix for enabling core dumps if they are enabled via cookbook attribute ([PR 174](https://github.com/dev-sec/chef-os-hardening/pull/174))
